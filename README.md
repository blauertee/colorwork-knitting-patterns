# Generate Colorwork Knitting Patterns

This tool has been hacked together in a few hours. But might be a starting point.

One todo would be to release a binary so more inexperienced users can use it without having to install dependencies!

Feel free to contribute!

## How to use:
 - install python3
 - install scikit learn using pip
 - run the grid_pixelate_tool.py using python3

There should be plenty of tutorials available for those steps, they work a bit different depending on you operating system. If you have any troubles feel free to wite an issue here.
