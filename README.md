# Generate Colorwork Knitting Patterns

This tool has been hacked together in a few hours. But might be a starting point.

One todo would be to release a binary so more inexperienced users can use it without having to install dependencies!

Feel free to contribute!

## How to use:

#### Ubuntu
Run the install script with `bash ubuntu_install_script.sh` to uninstall run `bash ubuntu_install_script.sh uninstall`. 

Then you will find the app by searching colorwork in you installed applications.

#### Other 
 - install python3
 - install scikit-learn using pip
 - run the grid_pixelate_tool.py file using python3

There should be plenty of tutorials available for those steps, they work a bit different depending on you operating system. If you have any troubles feel free to write an issue here.
